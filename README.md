# AI-vs-Real-Art-classification-end-to-end
An end-to-end production grade CNN based project which attempts to classify the art as AI generated or Real Art, using MLFlow and DVC.

The detailed experimentation can be found at https://github.com/nithinpradeep38/AI-Vs-Real-Art-Classification 

We have used the following tools for MLOps

- MLFlow: For tracking experiments
- DVC: Data Version control
- Docker: For containerization of the code
- Github Actions: For CI-CD
- AWS EC2: Virtual machine for deployment
